# PCA (Principle Component Analysis)

PCA is used for dimensionality reduction. PCA transform a set of features in a data set into smaller number of feature called Principle Components while at the same trying to retain as much information in the original dataset.

## Steps of PCA

1. Feature standardization
2. Obtain the co variance matrix
3. Calculate the Eigen decomposition of the covariance matrix
4. Sort the Eigen values
5. Select the number of Principle components
